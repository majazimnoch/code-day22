# Flashcards with CSS Flip card effect

## Intro
This is day 21 of my 30-day coding challenge. The projects includes: HTML and CSS.

## Idea
I wanted to make flashcards effect with some English vocabulary which I didn't know before. 

## Code
Some new to me CSS properties:
`transform-style` - Specifies how nested elements are rendered in 3D space
`backface-visibility` - Defines whether or not the back face of an element should be visible when facing the user
